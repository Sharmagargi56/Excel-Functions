What is a function in Excel?
FUNCTION IS A PREDEFINED FORMUALS THROUGH WHICH WE CAN PERFORM CALCULATION & MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS IN EXCEL BY PROVIDING INPUT VALUES.

How do you start a function in Excel?
By using =sum(inputvalue1, inputvalue2)

What is the purpose of using functions in Excel?
To analyse data OPERATIONS with fast process. also it minimised the manual tasks.

What is the difference between a function and a formula in Excel?
-Function is predefined formual whereas  A formula (also known as an equation) is something that the user defines, and can use/refer to various functions )in it.
-A formula begins with an equal sign. Meanwhile, functions are used to perform complex calculations that cannot be done manually.
-formula is simply a MATHEMATICAL calculation whereas function can be used to handle large calculation via single words and inputs.
-function use single predefined formual whereas formula can use multiple function.

How can you enter a function manually in a cell?
By using below format:
=SUM(A3:B3)

What is the SUM function used for in Excel?
SUM IS USED TO PERFORM ADDITION OPERATION IN EXCEL.

How do you use the SUM function to add a range of numbers?
=SUM(A1:C2)

Explain the function of the AVERAGE function in Excel.
Average Function is used to evaluate average of the data.
we can use average in excel as:
=avg(A1:C2)

How do you find the highest value in a range of cells using a function?
=max(A1:C2)

What function can you use to find the lowest value in a range of cells?
=min(A1:C2)

How do you use the COUNT function to count the number of cells in a range that contain numbers?
=count(A1:C2)

What does the MAX function do, and how do you use it?
MAX will return the largest value in a given list of arguments.
=max(A1:C2)

What is the purpose of the MIN function in Excel?
Min will return the lowest value in a given list of arguments.
=min(A1:C2)

How can you use the IF function to create a simple logical test?
=IF(C1>120,"max", "min")
wherein c1> indicated condition & give max result if condition will true(max) else result will be False(min).

What does the CONCATENATE function do, and how is it used?
 CONCATENATE function aligns two seprate cells value in a single cell as below:
 =CONCATENATE(C8(text1 to be added with D8),D8(second text))

 Explain the function of the LEFT function in Excel.
Left gives the output starting from left and provide only those no which we have set in function.
For ex= from word gargi we want to access starting 3 words then we can use left as below:
=LEFT("Gargi", 3)

res-Gar

How do you use the RIGHT function to extract characters from a text string?
Right gives the output starting from Right and provide only those no which we have set in function.
=Right("Gargi", 3)

res=rgi

What is the purpose of the LEN function, and how do you use it?
Len gives the lenghth of text.
ex-
=Len("Gargi")

How can you use the VLOOKUP function to search for data in a table?
VLOOKUP function used to  search data vertically from a table.
vlookup stands for vertical lookup we can use this throigh below formula:
=vlookup(lookupvalue,table array, column index num, [range lookup])

What does the HLOOKUP function do, and when is it used?
HLOOKUP function used to  search data horizontally  from a table.
Hlookup stands for horizontal  lookup we can use this throigh below formula:
=Hlookup(lookupvalue,table array, column index num, [range lookup])

Explain the function of the DATE function in Excel.
The DATE function returns the sequential serial number that represents a particular date.
here is also if we will provide =date(2023,14,2)
then  system will give 2 feb 2024  (12+2 month will be seprated and 2023 become 2024)
Same is applicable for negative month
date(2023,-3,2) it will provide date in 2, september 2022.

How do you use the NOW function to display the current date and time?

The NOW function takes no arguments and requires only empty parentheses. The value returned by the function is a serial number representing a particular date and time in Excel.
=NOW()

What is the purpose of the TEXT function in Excel?
Formats a number and converts it to text
=T()

How do you use the SUMIF function to sum values based on a condition?

The SUMIF function is a premade function in Excel, which calculates the sum of values in a range based on a true or false condition.

=SUMIF(C23:C31,F24,D23:D31)
C23:C31range  which needs to be find.
F24 where we will put criteria
D23:D31 sum range


What is the COUNTIF function, and when is it used?

The COUNTIF function is a premade function in Excel, which counts cells as specified.

=COUNTIF(D23:D34,G32)
 (range, criteria)


 Explain the function of the AVERAGEIF function in Excel.
 The AVERAGEIF function is a premade function in Excel, which calculates the average of a range based on a true or false condition.
 
 =AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, avgrange)

 What is the purpose of the ROUND function, and how do you use it?

 The function will round up a number to a specified number of digits. 

=round(999.22585,3) will give 999.226


How do you use the CONCATENATE function to join text from multiple cells?
=CONCATENATE(A23,B23,C23,D23)

What is the difference between the AND and OR functions in Excel?

 **OR**function returns TRUE if at least one if the arguments evaluates to TRUE, and returns FALSE if all arguments are FALSE, whereas **AND** function is a premade function in Excel, which returns TRUE or FALSE based on two or more conditions

 For and All conditions need to be TRUE for the AND function to return TRUE.
 -for and we use:

 =AND([logical1], [logical2], ...)


=OR([logical1], [logical2], ...)
